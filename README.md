# DragonStallion-Common

Common library for personal projects

Currently, wraps up a dependency injection system with logging support into a fluent interface returning an `IServiceLocator`.

Hard dependency on [Autofac](https://autofac.org/) and [NLog](https://nlog-project.org/) because I quite like them and it's convenient.
